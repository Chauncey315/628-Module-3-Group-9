The MERRA dataset describes atmospheric and geographical data from 2010 to 2019 at a worldwide range. Variables in this dataset include temperature, wind velocity, air pressure, soil moisture, greenness index, etc. MERRA is originally produced by NASAâ€™s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) whose intention includes developing a forecast model, which coincides with one of our project goals.
