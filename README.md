# Data of the Project
Because the dataset is of size about 7GB, we will use [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) to load and analyze the dataset. To save the time of uploading dataset onto Goolge colab evrytime we start a new remote host, we upload the `csv` version of dataset onto Google Drive, and mount Google Drive to the remote host. 



One can get the dataset via the this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11vqfdfv8skQDKFc8RmT4S1HjFsQw1V7I?usp=sharing).
